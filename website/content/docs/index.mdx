Getting started with scaffdog is easy. We will show you how to install and start using scaffdog.

## Requirements

- Node.js v16.0.0+

## Installation

`scaffdog` can be installed globally, but we recommend installing it locally on the project.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev scaffdog
```

## Setup

scaffdog reads the documentation and configuration files in the `.scaffdog` directory by default. There are two ways to set these up.

### Automate

The `init` subcommand is the easiest way to set up.

```bash
$ npx scaffdog init

? Please enter a document name. hello

Setup of scaffdog 🐶 is complete!

  ✔ .scaffdog/config.js
  ✔ .scaffdog/hello.md

Now you can do scaffold by running `$ scaffdog generate`.

Please refer to the following documents and customize it.
https://scaff.dog/docs/templates
```

This completes the minimal setup. Easy!

### Manual

In some cases, depending on the project, you may want to perform the setup manually. No need to worry, however. Manual setup is not a difficult task.

First, create a `.scaffdog` directory and a configuration file.

```bash
$ mkdir .scaffdog
$ touch .scaffdog/config.js
```

Open `.scaffdog/config.js` with an editor and write the following:

```javascript
export default {
  files: ['*'],
};
```

Documentation does not yet exist, but this completes the minimal setup.

## Basic Usage

In the previous section, we have the environment we need to use scaffdog!  
Let's define a little practical documentation and actually generate the files.

### Write your first template

Let's take a [React](https://reactjs.org) project as an example for documentation.

Create the `.scaffdog/component.md` file and edit it as follows:

````markdown
---
name: 'component'
root: '.'
output: '.'
questions:
  name: 'Please enter a component name.'
  story:
    confirm: 'Do you need a story?'
    initial: true
---

# `{{ inputs.name | pascal }}/index.ts`

```typescript
export * from './{{ inputs.name }}';
```

# `{{ inputs.name | pascal }}/{{ inputs.name | pascal }}.tsx`

```typescript
export type Props = React.PropsWithChildren<{}>;

export const {{ inputs.name | pascal }}: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};
```

# `{{ !inputs.story && '!' }}{{ inputs.name | pascal }}/{{ inputs.name | pascal }}.stories.tsx`

```typescript
import { {{ inputs.name | pascal }} } from './{{ inputs.name | pascal }}';

export default { component: {{ inputs.name | pascal }} };
export const Overview = { args: {} };
```
````

Several sections appeared in the Markdown file. The title of `<h1 />` corresponds to the file name, and the code block that follows corresponds to the contents of the file.

In this example, three files would be generated!

### Run generate subcommand

Now let's actually generate a file from this document. Run the `generate` subcommand.

```bash
$ npx scaffdog generate

? Please select a document. component
ℹ Output destination directory: "."
? Please enter a component name. Button
? Do you need a story? Yes

🐶 Generated 3 files!

     ✔ Button/index.ts
     ✔ Button/Button.tsx
     ✔ Button/Button.stories.tsx

```

Entering the value `Button` in interactive prompt resulted in three files being generated :tada:

The contents of each generated file are as follows:

```typescript
// Button/index.ts
export * from './Button';

// Button/Button.ts
export type Props = React.PropsWithChildren<{}>;

export const Button: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};

// Button/Button.stories.ts
import { Button } from './Button';

export default { component: Button };
export const Overview = { args: {} };
```

We were able to scaffold with only one Markdown file :dog2:

Next, read the template documentation and feel free to build whatever template you need for your project.
